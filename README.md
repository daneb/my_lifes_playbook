# My Life's Playbook
### Look you are not likely to agree with everything here. Some of this is so brief is might spark controversy or some just not your point of view. I'm not selling this, I'm just sharing and collecting lessons learned for myself and theories I'm testing.

# A. Being A Christian

### Apologetics
>15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
>16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.

1. Is about bridging the gap between head and heart. Often times the questioner is left unaddressed.
2. We assume the conversation is largely intellectual.
3. We hinder the Holy Spirit by only responding using our own reason.

The first ground is the apologist himself.

### Terminology for non-believers:
1. Sin is a violation of purpose.

### Worldview
1. Everyone has a worldview and the question is whether we have a good one.
2. Worldview conceives your thoughts and ideas about the world.
3. A worldview is a framework to approach and basic questions around reality.

#### Atheism
1. Descended from naturalism.
2. Tries to explain everything material (explaining mental activity through physical activity is a fallacy)
3. If we all define our own meaning, that doesn't reflect in the natural world. It doesn't just except the reality of YOUR meaning.

#### Islam
1. Universe was created by a god. 
2. That god is distant and unknoweable.
3. Asking why in Islam is prohibited.

#### 4 Fundamental questions
a. _Origin_ - where does reality come from?  
b. _Morality_ - how should I live?  
c. _Meaning_ - is there purpose to live? (there is no why-questions only how-questions :( )  
d. _Destiny_ - where ultimately am I headed?  


# B. Being A Husband

### Love
1. Love is ever fleeting. And a husband needs to daily fan the flame of romance.
2. Everyday should be sought to winning the heart and imagination of his space. This is not a tireless effort from a realm of insecurity, but rather of confidence and surity and longetivity in a happy marriage.

### The Domain
1. The husband is king. But that doesn't discount the queen - her domain is the household. Be wary about interfering areas of expertise that God has called each of you too. Know your roles.

### Being Present
As a man it is easy to get caught up in one's own pursuits. In conquering, in building and in defining the future. However these pursuits can overwhelm the pre-frontal cortex making the husband non-present.
Non-present in conversation, non-present in being a husband and non-present in being a father.

*Don't line up your schedule or your plate with the insurmountable. You will lose your family.*
This is of course can be done over a defined period in mututal agreement with the family, but word to the wise "work" is an easy excuse for sub-consciously and consciously not being present.

### Personality
Know your personality type. Watch yourself. Note your patterns and the impact they have on your family.
For example: I have an addictive nature. And find it easy to immerse myself wholly into something at the expense and oppurtunity cost of other things. 

Don't live out the models of others, take the model of who you are, recognize it, and apply the patterns of how others resolved their own *demons*. Don't mirror, refract.


# C. Being A Father
### Anger -  
*First rule*
	Anger should never result in immediate action. It's often first sign of it being misplaced, misdirected and wrong.

#### Definition of Anger
	Incorrectly applied anger is an off itself self-gratification. It is selfish as it seeks to create an outlet for one's on emotional injustice. This form of anger is misapplied to someone or something else.

1. __Harmful affects of Anger__  
	To a child at the bitter end of this anger is loneliness, fear and shame. It isolates the child from the parent. It causes the child to be scared without a dad or mum to console. It breaks down the relationship. Far worse, pending the events the anger is linked to, it causes the child to bear a responsibility far beyond their years or even have an expectaction unnecessarily placed upon. It's hard being an adult, this weight should not be maliciously be imparted to a child.

2. __How to deal with Anger__

### Communication
1. Speak to your child with the respect given to an adult.
2. When accidents happen in the home (child breaking something), don't correct the behaviour there, particularly if the child is feeling guilty and cognisant of the impact. Rather clean up and provide wisdom after the emotions have subsided. 

### Guiding principals for raising kids
### A Family-focused life
### Games to play with the kids

# D. Being A Developer

## Problem Solving
1. Reason through First Principles
>The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. [When reasoning by analogy] we are doing this because it’s like something else that was done or it is like what other people are doing — slight iterations on a theme.
First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, “What are we sure is true?” … and then reason up from there.

## Bias
1. Survivorship bias - the tendency to ignore absent information and only ever plan for the best.
2. Endowment bias - the attribution of greater regard for that which already own, independent of actual value.
3. Hyperbolic discounting - immediate rewards don't always offer the greatest benefits, but you are still most likely to select them.
4. Clustering illusion - how we interpret groups of events can affect our ability to predict future probabilities
5. Confirmation bias - our process of gathering information to form our opinions is not as impartial as we may believe
6. Availability heuristic - the bias towards recent, easily remembered information when assessing importance and relevance in new situations
7. Stereotyping - while it may be associated with discrimination against minorities, stereotyping does have an innocent cognitive function.
8. Gambler's fallacy - an opposite effect to clustering illusion, this bias also results in faulty expectations.
9. Risk compensation - does perceived safety yield increased complacency? This question has significant implications for hazard management.
10. Anchoring bias - even business-savy people can fall foul to this bias towards initial information. the common human tendency to rely too heavily, or "anchor," on one trait or piece of information when making decisions.

## Clean code
1. Functions/Class names are inversly proportional to the scope ({}). Tests have very long names.
2. Variable names are directly proportional to their scope. 
3. Names should reveal intent. Avoid disinformation.
4. Classes names should be nouns. Avoid noise words - Data, Info, Manager.
5. Methods should be verbs.
6. It's rude to introduce a reader to high-level concepts and low-level concepts at the start of a function.
7. Functions should be small (4-20 lines). A line in a function should only be one-level of abstraction away from the name.
8. Functions should just do one thing. Aim for more functions then multiple lines with one layer of abstraction from name.

## Tests
1. Don't test functions directly. Tests will break when code breaks. This is why we don't test private functions.


## Principals to guide development:
1.  [High Cohesion, Loose Coupling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14000762/what-does-low-in-coupling-and-high-in-cohesion-mean)
2.  [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) - there should be at least one layer of indirection when working with a resource
3.  [Postels Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
4.  [Filter Inputs, Sanitize Output](https://benramsey.com/articles/escape-output/)

6.  [The Last Boy Scout Rule](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html)
7.  [YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)
8.  [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). This is predominantly about DRYing into business domains not drying across.
9.  Inch Wide Mile Deep - integrate early, extend functionality later
10. [Conway's Law](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-conways-law-improve-your-software-development)
11. [Fail Fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast)
12. [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
13. [Ego-less programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)
14. [Make it work, make it right, make it fast](http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast) *CRAWL, WALK, RUN*
15. The best code you can write, is not writing any at all
16. The best developer is the one who has had sufficient sleep (7+ hours).
17. Ensure consistency of implementation across code base
18. Make it work, make it right, make it fast CRAWL, WALK, RUN
19. The aim of agile is not to make the team go faster but to generate data to make improved decisions.
20. Comments usually mean you need to spend time cleaning the code. *regex

## Anti-Patterns 
*cut n paste from [Bipin Paul Bedi](https://www.bipinpaulbedi.com/2019/software-anti-patterns)*
### Organisational anti-patterns
* Analysis paralysis - Devoting disproportionate effort to the analysis phase of the project.
* Cash cow - A profitable legacy product that often leads to complacency about new product.
* Design by committee - The result of having many contributors to a design - but no unifying vision.
* Moral hazard - Insulating a decision-maker from the consequences of his or her decision.
* Stovepipe or Silos - A structure that supports mostly up-down flow of data but inhibits cross organisational communication.
* Vendor lock-in - Making a system extensively dependent on an external supplied component.
### Design anti-patterns
* Abstraction inversion - Not exposing implemented functionality required by user, so that they reimplement it using higher level functions.
* Ambiguous viewpoint - Presenting a model (OOAD) without specifying its viewpoint.
* Big ball of mud - A system with no recognisable structure.
* Database as IPC - Using DB as message queue for inter-process communication where a more lightweight mechanism would be suitable.
* Gold plating - Continuing to work on a project well past the point at which extra effort is not adding value.
* Inner - platform effect - A software so customisable as to become poor replica of software development platform.
* Input kludge - Failing to specify and implement handling of possibly invalid inputs.
* Interface bloat - making an interface so powerful that it is extremely difficult to implement.
* Magic push button - Coding implementation logic directly within interface code, without using abstraction.
* Race hazard - Failing to see consequences of different orders of events.
* Stovepipe system - A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components.
### OOD anti-patterns
* Anaemic domain model - Use of domain model without business knowledge.
* Base bean - Inheriting functionality from utility class rather than delegating to it.
* Call super - Requiring subclasses to call a superclass’s overridden method.
* Circle ellipse problem - Sub typing variable-types on the bases of value-subtypes.
* Circular dependency - Introducing unnecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies between objects.
* Constant interface - using interface to define constants.
* God object - Concentrating too many functionalities in a single part of design.
* Object cesspool - Reusing objects whose state does not confirm to the contract of reuse.
* Object orgy - Failing to properly encapsulate objects permitting unrestricted access to their internals.
* Poltergeists - Objects whose sole purpose is to pass information to another object.
* Sequential coupling - A class that requires its method to be called in a particular order.
* Yo-yo problem - A structure that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation.
* Dependency hell - Problem with versions of required product.
* DLL hell - Inadequate management of dynamic linked libraries.
### Programming anti-patterns
* Accidental complexity - Introducing unnecessary complexity into a solution.
* Action at distance - Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of system.
* Blind faith - Lack of checking of correctness of a bug fix or result of a subroutine.
* Boat anchor - Retaining a part of a system that is no longer has any use.
* Busy spin - Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated checking rather than message passing.
* Caching failure - Forgetting to reset an error flag when an error has been corrected.
* Cargo cult programming - Using patterns and methods without understanding why.
* Coding by exception - Adding a new code to handle each special case as it is recognised.
* Error hiding - Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user, either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message.
* Hard code - Embedding assumption about environment of a system in its implementation.
* Lava flow - Retaining undesirable code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences.
* Loop switch sequence - Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop.
* Magic numbers - Including unexplained numbers in algorithm.
* Magic strings - Including literal strings in code, for comparison, as event types etc.
* Soft code - Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code.
* Spaghetti code - Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible.
### Methodological anti-patterns
* Copy-paste programming. Copying (modifying) and pasting existing code rather than implementing generic solution.
* Golden hammering - Assuming that a favourite solution is universally applicable.
* Improbability factor - Assuming that it is improbably that a known error will occur.
* NHI syndrome - The tendency towards reinventing the wheel, assuming it does not exist here before.
* Premature optimisation - Coding early on for a perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design, maintainability, and sometimes even real world * efficiency.
* Programming by permutation - Trying to approach a solution by successively modifying the code to see if it works.
* Reinventing the wheel - Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution.
* Reinventing the square wheel - Failing to adopt an existing solution and instead adopting a custom solution which performs much worse than an * existing one.
* Silver bullet - Assuming that a favourite technical solution can solve a larger process or problem.
* Tester driven development - Projects in which new requirements are specified in bug reports.

## DDD
Domain-driven design 


## Algorithms
### Expression Trees
> Expression trees represent code in a tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression, for example, a method call or a binary operation such as x < y

> An expression tree provides a method of translating executable code into data. This can be very valuable if you want to modify or transform code before executing it. 

>Expression trees were created in order to make the task of converting code such as a query expression into a string that can be passed to some other process and executed there. It is that simple. There is no great mystery here, no magic wand that needs to be waved. One simply takes code, converts it into data, and then analyzes the data to find the constituent parts that will be translated into a string that can be passed to another process.

Their an abstraction to allow other processes to understand and transform the instructions for execution elsewhere.

# E. Being A Manager

1. Rules of managing
2. Manager's user manual for team

## 1. Rules of Managing
> Only by pride cometh contention - Proverbs 13:10

	* Lead by example but don't absolve responsibility.
	* Delegate.
	* Record all interactions, document and distribute.
	* Changes to processes need solid agreement.
	* Collaborate instead of dictate, but dictate when collaboration can't reach resolution.
	* Conflict is a natural part of business and it's healthy. Particularly where the individuals come from different backgrounds. This allows the shaping of problems and solutions in different ways. It's important to recognize that and to share your views (that are different) in a cordial manner. Contention is usually a sign of your ego kicking in.

## 2. Manager's User Manual

### What is this
It's the essence of how I operate as a Manager.
This is not a list of rules of how I operate, but the under-current of values and thinking that guides those operations.

* I am human
* I am a passionate husband and father. My family is a strong focus and my inspiration.
* I am an introvert, a creative, a change agent, potential seeker and a servant-leader.
* An avid reader and struggling gamer, yeah 3 kids ;)
* Truly enjoy yoga!
* My approach to life is guided by 5 principals (5 BE's):

* Be Simple - Large doors swing on small hinges (problems)
* Be Confident - Know you can. Trust you can. Practice so you can (attitude)
* Be Focused - Limit the scope to whats manageable and what produces the most immediate feedback (productivity)
* Be True - True To Self. True To Others. Seek truth in every situation as it's the only effective way to diagnose reality (character)
* Be Consistent - Habits done consistently produce effectivity (actions)


### Three core values

1. Radical Candour - caring for others requires candid communication.

2. Mutual Purpose - manage the stories we tell ourselves about others. In conflict seek to understand your purpose and that of the other person.

4. Psychological Safety - the effectiveness of our thinking relates to how we treat one another

### How I manage

1. I aim to set clear expectations and be direct about it's accountability. When I fail to do so adequately, please feedback.
I have a natural and genuine care for those who I am responsible for.

2. I eagerly welcome feedback with facts, examples and/or specifics. Vice versa.

3. If it doesn't work, lets build a plan, or just get rid of it.
I aim to do whats right. But sometimes right is not effective. If not harmful, do whats effective.

4. Everyone desires to give their best and is sincere in what they are trying to communicate.

5. "We don't click" can be an emotion based on the spiralling stories we have told ourselves. Seperate the facts from the stories.

6. I enjoy collaboration particularly with the multiplicity and diversity of minds.

7. If you not getting to deep work, reach out, I will do my utmost to figure out how to unblock you.
I am work in progress.

8. Critical thinking is not hard and imperfect. However it is not winning, it's weighing. Critical thinking needs to criticize something.


### Areas I'm working to improve...

Switching too quickly from problem definition to problem resolution.
Effecting change at a less rapid rate (at times).

# F. Just Being

## Schedule
1. Keep the same time to awake and the same time to rise (4:00 AM, 9:00 PM)
2. Quieten your mind 30 minutes before sleep (8:30 PM)
3. On weekends, stay up a little later (9:30 PM - 10:00 PM).

### Chess
1. Try castle as early as you can.
2. Always try interpret a minimal of 3 possible attacks from the enemy.
3. Don't fear attacks you can't see, only learn the lesson from not seeing them if there is.
4. Try dominate the centre four squares.
5. Try get as many pieces in *active* positions.
6. When severely attacked it's easy to negate our own resources. Open your eyes.
7. Setup traps that are disguised as alternate attacks.

### Coffee
1. Maximum of 2 double espressos a day.

# A. Being A Christian
	
# B. Being A Husband
### Being Present
As a man it is easy to get caught up in one's own pursuits. In conquering, in building and in defining the future. However these pursuits can overwhelm the pre-frontal cortex making the husband non-present.
Non-present in conversation, non-present in being a husband and non-present in being a father.

*Don't line up your schedule or your plate with the insurmountable. You will lose your family.*
This is of course can be done over a defined period in mututal agreement with the family, but word to the wise "work" is an easy excuse for sub-consciously and consciously not being present.

### Personality
Know your personality type. Watch yourself. Note your patterns and the impact they have on your family.
For example: I have an addictive nature. And find it easy to immerse myself wholly into something at the expense and oppurtunity cost of other things. 

Don't live out the models of others, take the model of who you are, recognize it, and apply the patterns of how others resolved their own *demons*. Don't mirror, refract.


# C. Being A Father
### Anger -  
*First rule*
	Anger should never result in immediate action. It's often first sign of it being misplaced, misdirected and wrong.

#### Definition of Anger
	Incorrectly applied anger is an off itself self-gratification. It is selfish as it seeks to create an outlet for one's on emotional injustice. This form of anger is misapplied to someone or something else.

1. __Harmful affects of Anger__  
	To a child at the bitter end of this anger is loneliness, fear and shame. It isolates the child from the parent. It causes the child to be scared without a dad or mum to console. It breaks down the relationship. Far worse, pending the events the anger is linked to, it causes the child to bear a responsibility far beyond their years or even have an expectaction unnecessarily placed upon. It's hard being an adult, this weight should not be maliciously be imparted to a child.

2. __How to deal with Anger__

### Communication
1. Speak to your child with the respect given to an adult.
2. When accidents happen in the home (child breaking something), don't correct the behaviour there, particularly if the child is feeling guilty and cognisant of the impact. Rather clean up and provide wisdom after the emotions have subsided.

# D. Being A Developer

## Principals to guide development:
1.  [High Cohesion, Loose Coupling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14000762/what-does-low-in-coupling-and-high-in-cohesion-mean)
2.  [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) - there should be at least one layer of indirection when working with a resource
3.  [Postels Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
4.  [Filter Inputs, Sanitize Output](https://benramsey.com/articles/escape-output/)
5.  [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
6.  [The Last Boy Scout Rule](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html)
7.  [YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)
8.  [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). This is predominantly about DRYing into business domains not drying across.
9.  Inch Wide Mile Deep - integrate early, extend functionality later
10. [Conway's Law](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-conways-law-improve-your-software-development)
11. [Fail Fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast)
12. [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
13. [Ego-less programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)
14. [Make it work, make it right, make it fast](http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast) *CRAWL, WALK, RUN*
15. The best code you can write, is not writing any at all
16. The best developer is the one who has had sufficient sleep (7+ hours).
17. Ensure consistency of implementation across code base
18. Make it work, make it right, make it fast CRAWL, WALK, RUN
19. The aim of agile is not to make the team go faster but to generate data to make improved decisions.

## DDD
Domain-driven design 


## Algorithms
### Expression Trees
> Expression trees represent code in a tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression, for example, a method call or a binary operation such as x < y

> An expression tree provides a method of translating executable code into data. This can be very valuable if you want to modify or transform code before executing it. 

>Expression trees were created in order to make the task of converting code such as a query expression into a string that can be passed to some other process and executed there. It is that simple. There is no great mystery here, no magic wand that needs to be waved. One simply takes code, converts it into data, and then analyzes the data to find the constituent parts that will be translated into a string that can be passed to another process.

Their an abstraction to allow other processes to understand and transform the instructions for execution elsewhere.

# E. Being A Manager

1. Rules of managing
2. Manager's user manual for team

## 1. Rules of Managing
> Only by pride cometh contention - Proverbs 13:10

	* Lead by example but don't absolve responsibility.
	* Delegate.
	* Record all interactions, document and distribute.
	* Changes to processes need solid agreement.
	* Collaborate instead of dictate, but dictate when collaboration can't reach resolution.
	* Conflict is a natural part of business and it's healthy. Particularly where the individuals come from different backgrounds. This allows the shaping of problems and solutions in different ways. It's important to recognize that and to share your views (that are different) in a cordial manner. Contention is usually a sign of your ego kicking in.

## 2. Manager's User Manual

### What is this
It's the essence of how I operate as a Manager.
This is not a list of rules of how I operate, but the under-current of values and thinking that guides those operations.

* I am human
* I am a passionate husband and father. My family is a strong focus and my inspiration.
* I am an introvert, a creative, a change agent, potential seeker and a servant-leader.
* An avid reader and struggling gamer, yeah 3 kids ;)
* Truly enjoy yoga!
* My approach to life is guided by 5 principals (5 BE's):

* Be Simple - Large doors swing on small hinges (problems)
* Be Confident - Know you can. Trust you can. Practice so you can (attitude)
* Be Focused - Limit the scope to whats manageable and what produces the most immediate feedback (productivity)
* Be True - True To Self. True To Others. Seek truth in every situation as it's the only effective way to diagnose reality (character)
* Be Consistent - Habits done consistently produce effectivity (actions)


### Three core values

1. Radical Candour - caring for others requires candid communication.

2. Mutual Purpose - manage the stories we tell ourselves about others. In conflict seek to understand your purpose and that of the other person.

4. Psychological Safety - the effectiveness of our thinking relates to how we treat one another

### How I manage

1. I aim to set clear expectations and be direct about it's accountability. When I fail to do so adequately, please feedback.
I have a natural and genuine care for those who I am responsible for.

2. I eagerly welcome feedback with facts, examples and/or specifics. Vice versa.

3. If it doesn't work, lets build a plan, or just get rid of it.
I aim to do whats right. But sometimes right is not effective. If not harmful, do whats effective.

4. Everyone desires to give their best and is sincere in what they are trying to communicate.

5. "We don't click" can be an emotion based on the spiralling stories we have told ourselves. Seperate the facts from the stories.

6. I enjoy collaboration particularly with the multiplicity and diversity of minds.

7. If you not getting to deep work, reach out, I will do my utmost to figure out how to unblock you.
I am work in progress.

8. Critical thinking is not hard and imperfect. However it is not winning, it's weighing. Critical thinking needs to criticize something.


### Areas I'm working to improve...

Switching too quickly from problem definition to problem resolution.
Effecting change at a less rapid rate (at times).

1. Being a Dad
	- Anger: Incorrectly applied anger is an off itself self-gratification. It is selfish as it seeks to create an outlet for one's on emotional injustice. This form of anger is misapplied to someone or something else.
 	- Child: To a child at the bitter end of this anger is loneliness, fear and shame. It isolates the child from the parent. It causes the child to be scared without a dad or mum to console. It breaks down the relationship. Far worse, pending the events the anger is linked to, it causes the child to bear a responsibility far beyond their years or even have an expectaction unnecessarily placed upon. It's hard being an adult, this weight should not be maliciously be imparted to a child.

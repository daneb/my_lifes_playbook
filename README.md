	1. Anger
	First rule
	 Anger should never result in immediate action. It's often first sign of it being misplaced, misdirected and wrong.

	Definition of Anger
	 Incorrectly applied anger is an off itself self-gratification. It is selfish as it seeks to create an outlet for one's on emotional injustice. This form of anger is misapplied to someone or something else.
 	
	Harmful affects of Anger
	 To a child at the bitter end of this anger is loneliness, fear and shame. It isolates the child from the parent. It causes the child to be scared without a dad or mum to console. It breaks down the relationship. Far worse, pending the events the anger is linked to, it causes the child to bear a responsibility far beyond their years or even have an expectaction unnecessarily placed upon. It's hard being an adult, this weight should not be maliciously be imparted to a child.

# E. Being A Manager
## Manager's User Manual

### What is this
It's the essence of how I operate as a Manager.
This is not a list of rules of how I operate, but the under-current of values and thinking that guides those operations.

* I am human
* I am a passionate husband and father. My family is a strong focus and my inspiration.
* I am an introvert, a creative, a change agent, potential seeker and a servant-leader.
* An avid reader and struggling gamer, yeah 3 kids ;)
* Truly enjoy yoga!
* My approach to life is guided by 5 principals (5 BE's):

* Be Simple - Large doors swing on small hinges (problems)
* Be Confident - Know you can. Trust you can. Practice so you can (attitude)
* Be Focused - Limit the scope to whats manageable and what produces the most immediate feedback (productivity)
* Be True - True To Self. True To Others. Seek truth in every situation as it's the only effective way to diagnose reality (character)
* Be Consistent - Habits done consistently produce effectivity (actions)


### Three core values

1. Radical Candour - caring for others requires candid communication.

2. Mutual Purpose - manage the stories we tell ourselves about others. In conflict seek to understand your purpose and that of the other person.

4. Psychological Safety - the effectiveness of our thinking relates to how we treat one another

### How I manage

1. I aim to set clear expectations and be direct about it's accountability. When I fail to do so adequately, please feedback.
I have a natural and genuine care for those who I am responsible for.

2. I eagerly welcome feedback with facts, examples and/or specifics. Vice versa.

3. If it doesn't work, lets build a plan, or just get rid of it.
I aim to do whats right. But sometimes right is not effective. If not harmful, do whats effective.

4. Everyone desires to give their best and is sincere in what they are trying to communicate.

5. "We don't click" can be an emotion based on the spiralling stories we have told ourselves. Seperate the facts from the stories.

6. I enjoy collaboration particularly with the multiplicity and diversity of minds.

7. If you not getting to deep work, reach out, I will do my utmost to figure out how to unblock you.
I am work in progress.


### Areas I'm working to improve...

Switching too quickly from problem definition to problem resolution.
Effecting change at a less rapid rate (at times).
